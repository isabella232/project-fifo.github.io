# Project-FiFo Community Code of Conduct (CoC) #

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to the FiFo community. It applies to all &quot;collaborative space&quot;, which is defined as community communications channels (such as  mailing lists, IRC, submitted patches, commit comments, etc.).

## Core Principles : ##
 
* We are respectful and appreciative towards peoples work, time and effort.
* We are tolerant of peoples right to have opposing views.
* Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
* When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
* Participants who disrupt the collaborative space, or participate in a pattern of behaviour which could considered harassment will not be tolerated.
* Violations of the CoC should only be reported to the maintainers via direct messages on IRC, twitter or via e-mail and will be handled confidentially. Neiter reporters nor reported persons will, or should be, be made public.
