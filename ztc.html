          The FiFo Zero Touch Cloud is a unique hybrid offering from the Project-FiFo team that combines a purpose built <strong>hardware appliance</strong> with a 100% managed service offering. In response to customer feedback, “Zero Touch Cloud” was developed as a comprehensive solution - purpose built to enable customers to focus on their core business while making it as simple as possible to run a highly available cloud.
        </p>
        <h3 class="fztch3">ZTC Advantages</h3>        
        <p>
          With FiFo ZTC, building a cloud becomes as easy as <strong>racking and connecting your hypervisors</strong>. “Zero Touch Cloud” lets you leverage the expertise and knowledge of Project-FiFo’s team, so that you can put the focus on where it should be - running your business.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zero Touch Cloud, frees up your ops team to look after their core duties, while we take care of maintaining your FiFo installation. ZTC ships as a hardware appliance and therefore will not detract form your existing compute resources - making the most out of your hardware. All updates are scheduled to prevent disruption to your operations and to ensure that your FiFo Cloud is always up to date.
        </p>
        <h3 class="fztch3">Exclusive Enterprise Features</h3>         
        <p>
          “Zero Touch Cloud” includes exclusive <strong>enterprise only</strong> features.

          Things like <strong>DHCP/PXE</strong> boot which makes adding new compute nodes as easy as plug and play. New <strong>Audit log tracing</strong> means you never have to wonder who did what and when and ties into <strong>VM time accounting</strong> which allows for easy billing system integration. 

          <p>Do you have users/customers that have predictable patterns or workloads? - then you will appreciate ZTC’s new ability to pre-warm datasets and virtual machines. This ensures that VM’s are already created prior to provisioning, so that customer machine creation is near instantaneous.</p> 

          At FiFo, we care deeply about open source yet recognise the practical need for a commercial customer tier with enterprise only features to ensure sustained project growth. We retain these Enterprise features exclusively for our ZTC customers.
