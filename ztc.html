      <h2>FiFo Zero Touch Cloud</h2>

        <p>
          The FiFo Zero Touch Cloud is a unique hybrid offering from the Project-FiFo team that combines purpose built hardware with a 100% managed service. In response to user feedback Project-FiFo has developed a solution that allows customers to focus on their core business while running an ultra high available, battle tested cloud orchestration suite.
        </p>
        <p>
          What makes the Zero Touch Cloud unique is the turn key approach. Upon signing for the FiFo Zero Touch Cloud a customer is shipped a cluster of purpose built servers with Project-FiFo pre-installed and configured for their site. After racking the hardware, the customer never has to touch it again. The team that hand crafted FiFo and knows it best manages every aspect from event monitoring to update management, leaving you free to run your business.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of a fully managed installation on worry free hardware Zero Touch Cloud also includes exclusive enterprise features to make your life easier. Things like DHCP/PXE boot makes adding new nodes as easy as plug and play. Audit log tracing means you never have to wonder who did what and when. Built in VM time accounting makes integrating with you billing system simple so getting paid is easy. Have users that are predictable? Enterprise pre-warming of datasets and virtual machines means that you can have VMs already running before your customer buys so that provisioning is nearly instantaneous. We care about open source and want everybody to use FiFo but paying customers allow for the project to grow and remain sustainable so we save something a little special for these customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nobody likes lock in and that includes us. We work hard to make FiFo a good cloud citizen. If at the end of your contract you do not want to renew you can migrate the information to an open source FiFo installation that you manage or just use the tools your OS of choice provides. We are sure that you will love all the awesome features with a hands off approach that Zero Touch Cloud brings to your cloud and look forward to working with you in running the best and most reliable cloud orchestration service available.

          <li>Support for SmartOS, OmniOS<sup>2</sup>, and Oracle Solaris<sup>3</sup> as hypervisor nodes.</li>
